# CERN BE-CSS-GTA PyUI Prototype

This repository contains a prototype demonstration for the CERN BE-CSS-GTA position (2025-83-GRAE), showcasing skills in Python UI development with PyQt and domain knowledge of particle accelerator operations.

## Project Overview

The prototype demonstrates a Python-based UI framework (PyUI) built on PyQt that provides specialized components for particle accelerator control and visualization. This directly addresses the requirements in the job description for developing PyUI and the Sequencer UI for CERN's particle accelerator operations.

## Repository Structure

- **PyUIPrototype/**: The main Python prototype showcasing PyUI framework and accelerator visualization
- **Sample Applications/**: Reference material and sample applications (not part of the prototype)

## Key Features

- **PyUI Framework**: A component-based UI framework built on PyQt
- **Accelerator Visualization**: Interactive visualization of particle beams in an accelerator
- **Sequencer UI**: Interface for creating and executing operation sequences
- **Physics Models**: Simplified models of accelerator physics
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean separation between UI, controllers, and domain models

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- PyQt6
- Object-oriented design principles
- Component-based UI architecture

## Getting Started

See the README in the PyUIPrototype directory for detailed instructions on running the prototype.
